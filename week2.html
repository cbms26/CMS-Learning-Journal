            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            
            <h4>Getting started with Joomla</h4>
            <p>
            I skimmed through the Learning Resources Video for week 2 in LinkedIn which explained on content management
            system and using of WordPress. As for the practical, Joomla CMS was entirely new to me. I went through
            various sites and youtube videos (mainly <b>WebTech with Brett</b>), helping me understand how to install Joomla,
            what it is, and how to use it for developing a website. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Working with Joomla</h4>
            <p>
            Frankly, Joomla installation was not an easy task. However, after successfully installing Joomla, it took
            some time to get fond with the features and functionality included. I found out that we can also, do html
            coding and created custom css to override the default css styling of Joomla. Hence, I almost worked more on
            using html and css skills inside the Joomla article content, where I finally created my website <b>'CODEBOTs'</b>
            using Joomla version 5.
            <br>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Exporting Joomla files to Github repository for web-hosting</h4>
            <p>
            Initially, I could not upload my Joomla files to GitHub repo. I learned that backing up or exporting Joomla files allows me to do that. <b>Akeeba Backup</b> was a useful Joomla Extension Directory, which allowed me to create full backup of my Joomla site. After this process, I directly committed my Joomla files to the github repo. I generated the website link, where it
            only displayed 'Error 404'. Just like I hoped, that it won't be an easy task to shift or get a live server.
            Upon researching the error, I learned that Github provides the web-hosting for static website only. Any CMS
            websites created are dynamic. Then, I converted my dynamic website to static by some free third-party
            software (called <b>HTTrack Website</b>), then pushed it to Github which resolved the error.

            <h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
            <p>Understanding and working with Joomla took me about <b>8 hours</b> to develop the same startup website
                from previous practical.</p>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>This week, I learned that Joomla is a powerful CMS platform like WordPress. The installation process itself was challenging, and getting accustomed to its features and functionalities required persistence and patience. However, the ability to incorporate custom HTML and CSS within Joomla was a significant advantage. This helped me to successfully develop my website where I mostly used the Article Content of the Joomla as an editor rather than a content (by changing the default settings in Joomla cpanel). The website is much similar to the previous practical. I have created my own custom.css file inside Joomla cassiopeia template, where I was able to make custom styling to the contents. However, changing the background color of the header and footer was a burden, leaving it be in default color. <br>
                In addition, I understood how static websites and dynamic websites differ, particularly when it comes to hosting. This knowledge is vital for future when working on web development projects, as it influences the choice of hosting platforms.
            </p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>Practically, working with Joomla has been a valuable expreience that has broadened my understanding of CMS platforms. There are multiple CMS tools such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and many more, where if gained proficiency in one or as many CMS tools, enhances my skills as a web developer and makes me more attractive to potential employers. The challenges I have faced and overcame, such as converting dynamic site to a static one for hosting on GitHub, have demonstrated my ability to adapt and learn new technologies quickly. This adaptability is crucial in tech industry, where staying updated with the latest tools and technologies is essential for career growth. <br>
            Additionally, this experience has emphasized the importance of patience and persistence. Overall, this week has highlighted the value of continuous learning and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, both of which are crucial for career development in web development.
