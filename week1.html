            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <p>In this first week, we went throught the subject outline and the assessments included which was mainly related to working with WordPress and Joomla. I also visited and watched the link shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development-14628245/">Week 1-Calender.</a> which helped me recollect working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The link also helped me re-grasp my knowledge on using Github for web-hosting and synchronizing my VS Code with the online repositories.</p>

            <h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
            <p>I have spent around 3 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including lecture session.</p>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>Working on practical 1 helped me recapture my knowledge and expreience on the basics of HTML and CSS coding. With this coding skills, I developed the website 'CODEBOTs'. Additionally, I relearned about Bootstrap, which helps in responsiveness and website visuals. The first practical made it easier for me to work again with the Github where I have once used it to write my coding project.  </p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>Developing the basic website, made me realize I have much more to learn if I am to create a better content for a website, that would make it look visually appealing for any random clients or viewers. Hence, I am enthusiatically looking forward in developing those professional Content Management skills from this module that would eventually be of great beneficial for my future.</p>
