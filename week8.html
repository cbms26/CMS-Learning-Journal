            <h3>Learning Activities</h3>
            <h4>Learning Experiment topic: Consistent Practice with Iterative Feedback Enhance CMS Proficiency </h4>
            <h4>Theory</h4>
            <p>The theory of <b>deliberate practice</b> (Source: <a href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory">https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory</a>) suggests that a consistent and focused practice, when integrated with feedback loop for improvement, helps in expertising complex skills. This theory hypothesize that a skill practice must be intentional involving reflective feedback loop rather than performing a task repetitively until mastered.</p>
            <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
            <p>Using the theory of deliberate practice to solve CMS practical and assessments, in order to have significant improvements in practical skills, understanding and the ability to fix any issues.</p>
            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preparation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conduct self-assessment such as quiz or practical task or assignment to measure my existing CMS skills.</li>
                    <li>Choose a CMS platform (for e.g. WordPress), then develop any website project. This should help serve me as the basis for iterative development and practice.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Practice Session</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establish a schedule to achieve consistent practice. For instance, I have taken one session of 4-6 hours each week to complete my CMS practical tasks. Each session or practical task required me to focus on praticular aspect of CMS such as plugin installation, child themes and so on. </li>
                    <li>Develop the project iteratively, starting with basic setup and then adding features. Maintain a document of my progress, challenges faced and solutions required for each issues. For example, working on CMS assignment 1: Website Development required all these to successfully complete.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Feedback Loop</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After every session, self-reflect on the work similar to maintaining Learning Journal each week of the CMS class session.</li>
                    <li>Get peers feedback of the progress made to identify if there is any improvement needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h4>Test</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Post-Practice Tasks</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar to weekly practical task of CMS subject, performing a set of tasks to those learnt concepts during each learning session. This helps measure the improvment in understanding and skills</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Project Evaluation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting detailed review of the completed project.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Skill Recall</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After a break of a week, perform another new task to uptake new issues. This will help in retaiing the skills learned. </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Assessment Scores</li>
                <li>Project Quality</li>
                <li>Retention Test Performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
            <p>Approximately <b>2 hours</b> of leisure time</p>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>From week 8, the learning experiment practical focused on researching scientific method that is applicable for observation and testing. This experiment showcased, although unknowingly, I have dedicated my time in performing specific CMS tasks (such as practical or assignment) and also maintaining a weekly journal, reflecting myself of lessons learnt. Ultimately, this process not only improved my understanding and practical skills but it also helped me in retaining the knowledge. The theory of deliberate practice demonstrates how it can be an effective way for mastering complex technical skills of Content Management System.</p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned, unconsiously following the deliberate practice theory in CMS asssessments has significantly enhanced my technical skills that could benefit me in the industry. By consistently engaging myself in tasks and iterative feedback will help me develop strong problem-solving skills and also understanding CMS functionalities more deeply. This will improve my technical proficiency and equip me with more professional skills. Such skills will be crucial for a successful career in web development background.</p>
