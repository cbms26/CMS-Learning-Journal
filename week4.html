            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <h4>Importance of deployment and production</h4>
            <p>In Week 4, I grasped the importance of development process of a website. Amongst three deployment process options, choosing to <b>Work locally</b>, <b>Staging</b> and then <b>Production</b> seemed to have more benefits over working on a direct live server or skipping the staging process. The staging process would generally help give feedbacks to the website before actual prodcution occurs. <br>
                In addition, I also understood the <b>workflow</b> involved in ensuring a smooth transition from development to deployment and production. It includes thorough testing, debugging and optimizing during staging process which reduces the errors before going for live production on the live server. Such kind of approach ensures a more stable and reliable website for users.
            </p>

            <h4>Deployment utilized for practical</h4>
            <p> To be frank, it was a difficult task to follow the above approach practically. On the other hand, I learnt to deploy my locally created WordPress website to a published web server or a live server. Using Local by Flywheel, generally made it easier to install WordPress in my local environment where I could develop my website. However, the locally developed website should be published to a live server for site production. There are various ways to deploy localhost site to a web server. I chose to use the <b>All-in-One wordpress migration plugin</b> offered by the WordPress itself where I exported my files for it to be sent. Then, <b> CCP (Cloud Control Panel) cloudaccess</b> site provided live server for dynamic sites allowing managing databases for the site. The exported files of my localhost site was then imported to the CCP cloudaccess. Hence, successfully deploying or producing my local site to a web server. However, some features are restricted to free users such as Github integration and database profiler. 
                <br>
            After completing my practical, I wondered on how the staging process is actually working or seen during site development and production as I have not used Github version control. Since, this was an individual task, staging process must have passed unknowingly while working on my site.

            <h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
            <p>About 2 hours of work, excluding lecture time.</p>
<br><br>
            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>I delved into the critcal stages of website development where a development process involved local development, staging process and live production. It is now known to me that this appraoch helps in identifying and fixing errors before production and also gives more stable and reliable final website. The practical experience of deploying my locally created WordPress site to a live server highlighted the challenges and importance of staging process. <br>Furthermore, I explored various deployment methods such as using FTP to migrate, ultimately using the All-in-One WordPress migration plugin that facilitated smooth transition from my local environment to live server. <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>This week's activities significantly enhanced my understanding to deployment of a local site and my technical and problem-solving skills which is both crucial for a career in web development or IT infrastructure. The hands-on experience of deploying a website using tools like All-in-One migration plugin and Local by Flywheel showcases my ability to adapt and work with new technologies. <br>
            Moreover, understanding the workflow from development to deployment underscored the importance of testing and optimization, which are essential to ensure stable and reliable website. For further improvement to myself, gaining skills in version control systems like GitHub will be profitable, as they are pivotal for working in collaboration projects.</p>
