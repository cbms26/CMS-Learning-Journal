            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <p>In week 6, we mainly focused on our group assessment, which is to develop James Cook University Brisbane
                Student Board website. All members of our group are connected with each other on various platforms. The
                private <b>Slack</b> channel is used for team communication, the <b>Github Repository</b> is for
                managing version control and the <b>Github Project</b> will be used for project management.
                <br>
                As per the client's requirement, we have completed the <b>Planning Phase</b> of our project. This phase
                played a critical role in ensuring what needs to be done next by identifying key tasks and setting
                priorities. It consisted of sharing individual ideas on major pages of the project, highlighting all
                possible sub-menus, page contents, internal and external links to the pages. Additionaly, the rough
                visual design for each page has been constructed, allowing us to proceed to the <b>Development
                    Phase</b> of our project.
                <br>
                The project website is to be developed via local environment instead of developing directly on live
                server as to further understand the working of recommended web development approach, i.e. <b>Local
                    environment,
                    Staging process </b>and then <b>live production.</b>
                <br><br>
                In summary, our project will consists of three phase, they are;
                <li>Planning Phase</li>
                <li>Development/Design Phase</li>
                <li>Production Phase</li>
                These phases will guide us to the success of the project.
            </p>

            <h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
            <p>About <b>5 hours</b> of team discussion on slack platform.</p>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>During Week 6, we successfully completed the Planning Phase, which involved identifying key tasks and setting priorities. We shared individual ideas for the project's major pages, outlined possible sub-menus, determined page contents, and identified necessary internal and external links. Additionally, we created rough visual designs for each page, which guided us in the Development Phase. The private Slack channel facilitates effective team communication, while the GitHub Repository manages version control, and GitHub Project for project management. This integrated approach will ensure seamless collaboration and keep everyone on the same page. Developing the project in a local environment before moving to staging and production help us understand the recommended web development approach and keep us prepared for real-world applications.</p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>This project will significantly enhance our career readiness by providing practical experience, individually and as a team, in project management and web development. We will also gain hands-on experience with essential tools like Slack, GitHub Repository, and GitHub Project, which are widely used in the industry. This experience will equipp us with the skills needed to manage projects, collaborate effectively with team members, and maintain version controls. By following a structured development approach: local environment, staging, and production, we learn industries best practices that will be invaluable in our future careers. These skills will not only make us more attractive to potential employers but also prepare us to contribute effectively. Our ability to navigate the complete development cycle from planning to production will demonstrate our readiness to tackle complex projects and also deliver successful outcomes.</p>
