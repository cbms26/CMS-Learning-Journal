            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <p>Even though I have learned PHP years ago, from week 7, I have recalled substantial knowledge in various fundamental aspects of <b>PHP programming.</b> This simple practice has significantly helped me on of how PHP integrates with HTML to create dynamic and interactive web pages. The learning activities involved exploring PHP basics, using control structures like if/else statements and loops, defining functions, and handling form submissions. Additionally, I revisited the use of file inclusion to manage common elements like headers and footers which ensures a clean and maintainable codebase. 
            <br>
            The main tasks still involved group disucssion for development of JCUBSB website. After successful project planning, the page designing tasks has been proportionally divided among all members, requiring each member to commit their project on github repository before the due date. With the project deadline near, everyone is focused on their respective sections, ensuring that all elements align with the overall design and functionality requirements.

            <p>Approximately <b>3 hours</b> of leisure time</p>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>From week 7, I gained several important insights of PHP coding. It was indeed substantial. I revisited echosing HTML to dynamically generate web content, using control structures to manage the program flow, and also employing loops to generate repetitive tasks. Further, defining and using functions with parameters helped in organizing code, whereas handling HTML forms with PHP provided the importance of input validation. Understanding the file inclusion was also crucial for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase. 
            </p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>Engaging with PHP again has strengthened my technical proficiency and problem-solving skills, particularly in handling user inputs and dynamically generating web content. It has also improved my ability to organize code effectively, ensuring better maintainability and scalability for professional projects. Moreover, the focus on form handling has heightened my awareness of security practices which is essential for creating secure web applications. Participating in group activity has enhanced my ability to seek help and collaborate with the team members which is indeed a valuable skill in any professional environment.</p>
