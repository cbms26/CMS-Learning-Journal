            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <h4>What is a Child Theme?</h4>
            <p>Week 5 activity included learning and developing <b>child themes</b> in a WordPress. During all the development of websites for practical session, I have edited the parent theme itself, removing most of the theme's styles, which was not quite a good way to make changes. This is why child theme is important as it allows us to change small aspects of site's appearance, preserving theme's functionality. It is an extension of a parent theme.</p>

            <h4>How to build a child theme</h4>
            <p>Before starting to create child theme, it is significant to navigate/know the location of <b>file manager</b> of the WordPress site. At first, I worked on creating child theme on my live server WordPress site developed previously. However, it was quite a hurdle to locate file manager and even after finding it, I realized creating ZIP file from the live server site will be a hectic task later. Then, I started to create my <b>mytheme child</b> locally from my local environment. <br>
            For creating a child theme, it required us to navigate to <b>..wp-content/themes</b> and create new folder with a <b>style.css</b> and <b>functions.php</b> files inside that folder. Knowing this simple creation of folder and file helped me to successfully build child themes for the practical 5. 
            
            <h4>Challenges faced while working on practical</h4>
            <p>Regardless of how many times I have customized mytheme child's css file, it was hard to get it implemented on my site. What's amusing was that even after activating my custom child theme and customizing from the WordPress customization, the style.css of my child theme did not get updated. It only consisted of the commands I made. I also tried using the <b>inspection developers tool</b> to find the exact selector of elements but solutions couldn't be obtained. Nontheless, I understood the working of child theme and how it should be utilized.</p>
