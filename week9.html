            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <p>In week 8, The learning activities generally involved understanding what <b>Sass</b> is and how it works. Sass stands for <b>(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)</b>, it is a CSS preprocessor that allows for writing more maintainable and scalable CSS with features like variables, nesting, mixins and inheritance. By using Sass, developers can write more cleaner and more efficient CSS code. <br>
            After understanding what sass does, I have applied this knowledge to complete the practical 9. Typically, it invovled me to work on <b>VS Code Editor</b> and writing sass code that have the extension of <strong>.scss</strong> to demonstrate sass features. <br>
            Additionally, I also configured <b>Gulp</b> to automatically compile the process that also shows the user of the compilation. Running Gulp from terminal gives developers a visual changes and compiling of SCSS to CSS. <br>
            Now, I know the working of sass and I have attached a short screen recording of my practical task, where upon running Gulp from terminal, it automates the process of changing SCSS file and compiling with CSS file.

            <p>Approximately <b>3 hours</b> of leisure time.</p>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>From Week 8, I gained significant insights into using Sass and Gulp effectively. I learned how variables can simplify the management of styles by storing values like colors and fonts, and how nesting can organize CSS rules to follow the HTML structure that improves the readability and maintainability. Using mixins allowed me to reuse styles across different selectors, avoiding redundancy, while extend/inheritance helped create base styles that can be extended by other selectors for consistency. Automation with Gulp showcased the workflow by automating the compilation of SCSS to CSS, ensuring that the latest changes are always reflected in the stylesheets. These insights have not only improved my understanding and practical skills but also helped in working of sass knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>Although it was a basic task, engaging with Sass and Gulp has significantly enhanced my technical proficiency in CSS pre-processing and workflow automation. These skills are crucial for modern web development, as they lead to more efficient and maintainable code. The focus on automation with Gulp also prepared me for industry practices where automation tools are essential for managing complex projects. Participating in this practical has improved my ability to organize and maintain code effectively, a valuable skill in any professional environment.</p>
