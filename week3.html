            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>

            <h4>Joomla and WordPress</h4>
            <p> Last week, we learnt about Joomla CMS and also developed startup business website using Joomla features. However, WordPress offers different set of advantages and functionalities. As for me, installing Joomla to my local environment was challenging compared to WordPress. Joomla required <b>XAMPP Cpanel</b> to be installed and initiated, before installing itself whereas WordPress was easily installed to my local enviroment by <b>Local by Flywheel</b> software. <br>
            Futhermore, Joomla site structure was more complex and hard to navigate certain components. On the otherhand, I found WordPress more user-friendly and easy to use. I could smoothly navigate myself between pages, header, footer and other attributes of website any time for editing my website.</p>

            <h4>Working with WordPress</h4>
            <p>The difficulty that I experienced while working with Joomla made me appreciate WordPress even more. It was easy to install, easy to manage, and more easy to swap between site and site admin, which was indeed a more of CMS tool compared to Joomla. Nonetheless, Joomla CMS is meant for professional developers working on complex sites. <br>
            I found out about <b>Gutenberg</b> (Block Editor) feature offered by WordPress, which allowed to easily add, arrange and style web contents which made editing/managing content more efficient.
        
            <h4>Group Formation Reflection</h4>
            <p>During class session, we formed a group for our multimethod (group) assignment task which is crucial for communication and getting to know members. We talked and shared our skills, our strengths and weaknesses. Such team communication is a must before working on a project. With the team members, I am looking forward to enhance my team collaboration skills and the individual responsibilities to showcase their strenghts in order to acheieve a successful completion of the assignment.

            <h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
            <p>Developing the website using WordPress CMS tool took me around <b>5 hours</b> excluding class session.</p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding basics of both Joomla and WordPress has been enlightening experience for me. Joomla offered robust user management system with built-in multilingual support, where I found it challenging to cope with, mainly when compared to WordPress. <br>
                On the other hand, WordPress proved to be much more of content managing tool because of its user-friendly in nature. I admire how simple it was to install WordPress using Local by Flywheel software. The Gutenberg block editor was pivotal as it allowed me to easily add, arrange, and style the web content blocks which made the editing process more smooth and efficient. <br>
                For the practical, I developed my startup business, 'CODEBOTs' similar to previous weeks using WordPress. The contents are much similar to previous one, however some of the templates of WordPress restricted to make further edits. Creating the same website as before using WordPress, helped me to distinguish between websites using <b>HTML 5</b>, <b>Joomla</b> and <b>WordPress</b>.
                Knowing the hard word needed for designing website, WordPress proved to be more smooth between site transiton and also easy to use that led me to also choose WordPress over the other two.

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p> Although I just started working with WordPress and Joomla, the beginners experience has been invaluable for me and my future. Understanding the basics of both Joomla and WordPress has led me to prefer WordPress as it outweighs Joomla. This learning is not only important for now but also for my future career as web developer. <br> Moving forward, I plan to continue working on WordPress for upcoming assignment which will eventually boost my experience. I believe that working on it consistently and staying up-to-date will make me become close to being professional developer and also broaden my skills. Additionally, I plan to explore other CMS tools such as Drupal to further understand and gain skills from it.</p>
