            <h2>Week 10</h2>
            <h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
            <p>During Week 10, our team focused on finishing our project and getting ready for the presentation. Even though everyone was busy with other tasks and responsibilities, we made sure to hold a crucial team meeting this week. This meeting was essential as it allowed us to check our progress, address any remaining issues, and make sure everyone was on the same page. Despite our busy schedules, the meeting helped us make significant progress and stay organized as we approached the project deadline. We practiced many times to ensure our timing and content delivery were smooth and well-coordinated. These practice sessions were very helpful in improving our presentation and boosting our confidence. The resources we used, like presentation guidelines and tips for rehearsing, were very helpful in guiding us through this final stage.
            <br>
            Throughout this project timeline, each team member played multiple roles, contributing across various aspects of the project. Rather than sticking to one designated role, everyone brought their diverse skills to the table. This flexibility allowed us to be more dynamic and responsive to the needs of the project, ensuring that all bases were covered with expertise and creativity.

            <h3>Content Insights</h3>
            <p>From Week 10, the most significant insight was the power of adaptability and the importance of integrating multiple perspectives into a single cohesive presentation. Each member's ability to contribute beyond their traditional roles added depth and richness to the content. We discovered that when team members collaborate across different areas, the project benefits from a more comprehensive approach. For example, the technical aspects were not just delivered as raw content but were intertwined with visuals and a narration that made complex information accessible and engaging for our audience. This approach also allowed us to anticipate potential questions and prepare comprehensive responses, ensuring we were thoroughly prepared. By gully blending technical accuracy with creative presentation, we could share our project workflows more effectively and leave a lasting impression to our audience.</p>

            <h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
            <p>This week showed us how important it is to be flexible and work well with others in any type of tasks or job. In today's fast-changing work environment, being able to step outside your usual tasks and help with different parts of a project is a valuable skill. Our team's success proved that being adaptable not only improves the quality of work but also helps us understand the project much better. We learned that employers appreciate workers who can handle different tasks, contribute to various parts of a project, and work well in a team. Also, being able to explain complex ideas clearly and in an interesting way is a key skill that will help us stand out in our future careers. The mix of technical, creative, and communication skills we practiced this week will be important as we face future job challenges, making us more skilled and employable.</p>
